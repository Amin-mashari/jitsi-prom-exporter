# Examples
## Grafana dashboard
[grafana-dashboard.json](grafana-dashboard.json) shows a simple Dashboard example visualizing the most basic metrics, esp. the conferece_sizes histogram. Keep in mind that you propably have to change data sources etc. accordingly.

## Metrics
There are [example metrics](example-metrics.md), the exporter also exports a lot of metrics about itself (go runtime metrics) which are excluded in the example.
